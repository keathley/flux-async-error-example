# Flux async error example.  

Lots of people have questions about how to handle asynchronous errors in a React/flux applications so I thought I would try to create some examples of how I handle that in projects.

# Running the demo

    $ npm install
    $ webpack
    $ npm start

You should now have a running server on port 3000
